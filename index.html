        <p class="character-description">
            "I know you're trying to save lives. I am too! But we're on the brink right now, because we keep reacting to things we don't understand! We're scared, we're hurt, and we're reaching for violence because we can't figure out what do to. But just this once, can't we try something else?" - James Holden
